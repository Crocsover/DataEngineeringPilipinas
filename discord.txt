This is a Discord Channel dedicated for everyone who has access to datacamp. To those who don't have access yet, you are all still welcome. 

This is a channel where we can interactively learn from each other and make ourselves accountable. Given the free access that we have to datacamp (assuming you are given a slot by sir Myk) 
let's utilize all of the information that we can get from Datacamp. Remember, that we are given free access,  but please do not forget to contribute back to the community. 

This is a safe space for learning and anyone can join here.
