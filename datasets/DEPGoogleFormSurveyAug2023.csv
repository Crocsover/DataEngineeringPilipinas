The course can include the very basics like data extraction, data cleaning/ preparation, and loading data in the a cloud db or in a local db for simplicity.

Lastly I think it would be best if seniors can teach more on data modelling using pandas.

Ive seen tutorials on youtube using nyc taxi data, in which they uploaded the entire dataset as one table. The other tutorial used fact table and dimension table modelling and Im confused whether what to use best.
