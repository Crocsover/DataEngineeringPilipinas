Data Engineering Pilipinas is a community for data engineers, data analysts, data scientists, developers, AI / ML engineers, and users of closed and open source data tools and methods / techniques in the Philippines. 

This will serve as repository of notes, thoughts, ideas, plans, dreams, datasets, analyses, and whatever else we think of.
